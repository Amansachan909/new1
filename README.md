# UrbanCode Plugin Template
---

The UrbanCode Plugin Template project is a sample project that can be forked and used as a base for all community plugins.

When creating your own plugin, you will want to change all of the files in src/main/zip/info.xml and src/main/zip/plugin.xml. Documentation
for our plugins can be found in the [IBM UrbanCode Build Help Center](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8NMD_6.1.2/com.ibm.ucbuild.doc/topics/c_node_extend.html) or the [IBM UrbanCode Deploy Help Center](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.1/com.ibm.udeploy.doc/topics/c_node_extending.html).

### Compiling Source
`gradle`

The helloworld plugin .zip file can be found in build/distributions once the project has been built.
